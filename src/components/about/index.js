    <p>
      reParent emphasizes pairing a member of one generation with someone from a
      different generation. Our mentors understand that generations differ from
      each other in their strengths, preferences, working styles, and ways of
      thinking. These differences are an advantage rather than detriment in the
      community and workplace by creating an opportunity for members of those
      different generations to share their knowledge with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      We aspire to bring together these different generations in a one on one
      digital environment, fostering mutually beneficial dialogues, where
      questions on specific topics are answered and personal connections are
      enhanced. This is an environment where younger generations get to share
      information pertinent to their age group to older generations who struggle
      with new age technologies. Older generations get to share life and work
      experiences which provide them a great degree of usefulness and added
      value.
